"description":"\"Best App for Handwritten Notes\" - O'Reilly Best iPhone Apps\n\n\"Using Dan Bricklin’s Note Taker is a beautiful experience, as the app is a brilliant workaround to a formerly sticky situation. More important, it works like a charm.\" - John Fuller, Macworld.com (writing about version 1.0 . . . and version 2.0 is even better!)\n\nDan Bricklin's® Note Taker makes it easy for you to quickly write down and organize names, phone numbers, addresses, shopping lists, notes, and more. You write directly on the screen with your finger. It's like having a stack of note cards and a pencil always with you.\n\nPages are flexibly organized by date/time last modified, tags, favorites, and more, with thumbnail images of part of each page to help you find them later.\n\nYou can write in large letters on the screen rather than trying to make tiny motions like a pencil. Note Taker automatically shrinks your writing so you can fit a lot of text on the screen. You just keep writing and Note Taker automatically adds new writing next to the old. To quickly correct mistakes, it has a multi-level undo button as well as an eraser -- just drag your finger over the page to erase the \"ink\" under it. \n\nThe \"paper\" your writing ends up on is equivalent to about a 3\"x5\" card. You can write anywhere on it, so you can cross out shopping items as you buy them, go back and underline, draw diagrams, and more. You lay out the page the way you want. Use any markings: stars, underlines, and characters in any language. Create multiple pages. \n\nYou can email your notes as JPEGs, or save them to a photo album. \n\nThis Lite version has a limit of 15 pages at a time in the page list.\n\nNote Taker was designed and programmed by Dan Bricklin, the same person who 30 years ago came up with VisiCalc, the pioneering electronic spreadsheet that made working with numbers on a personal computer so easy. \n\nSee the Note Taker YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/DBNoteTaker -- MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THE \"How to write on the screen\" video or follow the \"Try It\" tutorial in the app itself to learn the \"trick\" to writing.", "bundleId":"com.softwaregarden.NoteTakerLite", "trackId":342311693, "trackName":"Note Taker Lite", "releaseDate":"2009-12-05T05:29:48Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,
"releaseNotes":"Version 2.0 is a major upgrade. Here are some of the changes: It adds thumbnails, tags, favorites, sorting, and more to the list of pages. Auto-advance now handles cursive handwriting better, especially when dotting an \"i\" or crossing a \"t\". The Lite version page limit has been raised to 15 pages. Writing is reportedly smoother on iPhone 3G and the older devices thanks to new code.\n\nSee www.youtube.com/DBNoteTaker for more information.", "formattedPrice":"Free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2010-03-17T22:12:45Z", "sellerName":"Software Garden, Inc.", "primaryGenreId":6007, "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "averageUserRating":3.0, "userRatingCount":3243},

"description":"\"...a true notepad experience that may help you make a clean break from the pencil-and-paper era.\"  -New York Times. \n  ===  Users describe Mental Note as \"the only notepad app... that's actually better than, and as simple as, a pen and paper.\" It's \"the future of note taking\", and \"a big sketchpad... [to] free associate and put stuff down in any format\".\n\nTurn your iPhone or iPod touch into a digital notepad.  Combine photographs, voice recordings, drawings and text - all on the same page, in any order you choose.\n\nAn idea... a flash - a moment of genius.  When a thought hits, and you have to remember it, why limit how you record it?  The more context and sensory details you can capture, the clearer the idea can be put down.  Use photographs, audio, sketching and text together on the same page... a digital page that can be shared with anyone.  \n\nMental Note allows you to capture ideas as they happen: use photographs, dictate, add text, sketch on anything.  Ideas clarified.  Creativity captured.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Draw with your finger using multiple colours and widths on top of photographs, text, or anywhere else on the page.  Zoom in to sketch fine details.\n\n- Take a photo or choose one from your album and add it to the page. \n\n- Add audio to the page by recording with the built-in microphone (iPhone) or an external microphone (iPod touch).

"description":"Jotter is the most appropriate tool to write a note on an iPhone or an iPad.\n\nJotter is like a notebook. You can easily write something quickly or draw a simple diagram with Jotter conveniently. Instead of a notebook, you can use Jotter to write or draw your idea in a quick, easy and convenient way. Jotter is acting like a real notebook. The size of you device is the size of your notebook, which will rotate automatically as you rotate the device, so what you see is what you get. If you want to use it in portrait mode, you can lay the device lengthwise. If you want to use it in landscape mode, you can lay your device widthwise.\n\nJotter provides three note lists: ‘My Notes’ list to manage note prepared on the device; ‘Favorites’ list showing notes designated as favorites; and iCloud list showing notes on iCloud. You can edit notes on ‘My Notes’ list and upload them to iCloud, if you have an iCloud account. You can change the type of a list by swiping the list view left or right.\n\nYou can use Jotter on all iOS devices (iPhone and iPad). If you have several devices, you can share your notes on all devices via iCloud.\n\n\nHandwriting\n• Provide a variable-width pen optimized for handwriting: if you write fast, the pen width becomes thinner, and vice versa. You can also use a fixed-width pen.\n• Provide a highlighter with which you can draw a translucent line over text.\n• Provide a zoom-in window, with which you can enter much more content on a limited space. It will also support you to write text more comfortably.\n• When writing on the zoom-in window, the window will move automatically to write without additional control. When you reach the right margin of the page, it will automatically move to the next line.\n• The zoom-in window supports both text directions: right-to-left and left-to-right.\n\niCloud\n• As notes made on several devices are stored in an iCloud stream, you can see all the notes on each device.\n• You can download a note to your device among notes stored in the iCloud stream. You can edit the downloaded note, and share it with other devices via iCloud.\n• For notes with different sizes (made on other devices), you can change the size and position of the notes when opening them.\n\nShare\n• You can send a note to other people via email as a JPEG or PNG file.\n• You can upload a note on SMS by using Copy function. Copy your content and paste it on a SMS window, then it will be sent to SMS.\n• You can store notes in My Photo list.\n• You can send your notes to your Twitter account set on your device.\n• You can send your notes to your Facebook account set on your device, or upload them by logging in Facebook.\n• You can send a note to other apps as a PDF file by using ‘Open with other app’ function.\n• Jotter will send an image as you can see on the screen. If you want to share a portrait image, lay the device widthwise and share the image. If you want to share a landscape image, lay the device lengthwise and share the image.", "bundleId":"com.groosoft.Jotter", "trackId":433839485, "trackName":"Jotter (Handwriting Notepad)", "releaseDate":"2011-05-02T18:50:21Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseNotes":"- Fixed restoring issue", "formattedPrice":"$0.99", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-02-03T22:03:11Z", "sellerName":"groosoft", "primaryGenreId":6007, "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":129},

"description":"\"...a true notepad experience that may help you make a clean break from the pencil-and-paper era.\"  -New York Times. \n  ===  Users describe Mental Note as \"the only notepad app... that's actually better than, and as simple as, a pen and paper.\" It's \"the future of note taking\", and \"a big sketchpad... [to] free associate and put stuff down in any format\".\n\nTurn your iPhone or iPod touch into a digital notepad.  Combine photographs, voice recordings, drawings and text - all on the same page, in any order you choose.\n\nAn idea... a flash - a moment of genius.  When a thought hits, and you have to remember it, why limit how you record it?  The more context and sensory details you can capture, the clearer the idea can be put down.  Use photographs, audio, sketching and text together on the same page... a digital page that can be shared with anyone.  \n\nMental Note allows you to capture ideas as they happen: use photographs, dictate, add text, sketch on anything.  Ideas clarified.  Creativity captured.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Draw with your finger using multiple colours and widths on top of photographs, text, or anywhere else on the page.  Zoom in to sketch fine details.\n\n- Take a photo or choose one from your album and add it to the page. \n\n- Add audio to the page by recording with the built-in microphone (iPhone) or an external microphone (iPod touch). Continue to edit your note while recording. \n\n- Organize your notes using tags. \n\n- Password protect your private notes and flag your important ones. \n\n- Attach Calendar events to your notes.\n\n- Undo, redo anything in the note by shaking the device.\n\n- Delete note sections using the toolbar button or by swiping any note section. \n\n- Move a note section by swiping and then dragging it to its new location.\n\n- Length of a note is limited only by device memory. \n\n- Export in a variety of formats including PDF, text, Mental Note format, and more.  Send using email, iCloud, Dropbox, and more.  \n\n* Send a note in Mental Note format so the note may be imported into another person's Mental Note app.\n\n* Using email, export a complete note directly from Mental Note as either a PDF document or a picture (each audio recording is attached to the email as a separate file; use QuickTime or another modern media player to play the attached audio).  You can also email just the text from your note.\n\n- Export your notes and backups to your iCloud and/or Dropbox account.\n\n- Share a note with your friends using Twitter. \n\n- Map the location a note was created at (if location services are enabled). \n\n- Change the size and font of the text in your notes. \n\n- Change the color and background of your notes. \n\n- Numerous other configuration options. \n\n- Supports all orientations.\n\n\nTHIS VERSION IS OPTIMIZED FOR iPhone & iPod touch.  FOR iPad, PLEASE SEE Mental Note for iPad.\n\n\nRead more: www.zymbiotic.com\nTwitter: @zymbiotic\nFacebook: facebook.com/zymbiotic", "bundleId":"com.zymbiotic.ZymbioticMentalNote", "trackId":338578109, "trackName":"Mental Note - the digital notepad", "releaseDate":"2009-11-20T22:25:40Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseNotes":"General improvements and bug fixes", "formattedPrice":"$3.99", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-09-29T03:45:55Z", "sellerName":"Zymbiotic Technologies", "primaryGenreId":6007, "genreIds":["6007", "6000"], "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":136},
